# Welcome
Hello and thank you in advance for your contribution!

# Group branching strategy
Our strategy is a home made version of a simplify version of Git Flow.
## 3 types of branch:
  * master  → stable version 
  * develop → developpement version, not very stable but with all the last new features 
  * feature → new fonctionality
## Convention
Every code are commited with a title and an associated git issue tag (e.g. `TITLE #nbIssue`)<br>
Feature branch example: `Feature/[ISSUE_NAME] #nbIssue`
